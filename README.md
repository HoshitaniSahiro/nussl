**nussl** (pronounced ["nuzzle"] (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nuzzle)) is a flexible, object oriented python 
audio source separation library created by the [Interactive Audio Lab] (http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/) 
at Northwestern University. At its core, nussl provides implementations of common source separation
algorithms as well as an easy-to-use framework for prototyping and adding new algorithms. The aim of nussl is
to create a low barrier to entry for using popular source separation algorithms, while also allowing the
user fine tuned control of low-level parameters.

**NOTICE: nussl is currently in alpha. Please be mindful.**
Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is [available here.](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/nussl/)

Note: This package has been tested with python 2.7, but not python 3.x yet. Use python 3 at your own peril!


Features
--------

At its core, nussl contains (or will contain) implementations of the following source separation algorithms:

Spatialization algorithms:
* Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET)
* PROJection Estimation Technique (PROJET) (**Coming Soon**)

Median filtering algorithms:
* REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET)
* REPET using the cosine similarity matrix (REPET-SIM)
* Harmonic/Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) (**Coming Soon**)
* Kernel Adaptive Modeling (KAM) (**Coming Soon**)

General matrix decomposition
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (**Coming Soon**)
* Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) (**Coming Soon**)

Medoldy tracking algorithms:
* Smooth-filters Instantaneous Mixture Model (SIMM) (**Coming Soon**)

The nussl team is also working on implementing an evaluation framework, which will include easy interoperability
between nussl and `mir_eval` (`bss_eval`) as well as implementations of other evaluation methods. (See development
branch)


Installation
------------

We recommend getting installing anaconda prior to using this package.

Installation is easy if you have pip (recommended):
```
$ pip install nussl
```

--or--

Once you've downloaded and decompressed the tarball, run setup.py like this:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

You can also download and copy the nussl folder into your working directory.


nussl requires:

`numpy, version >= 1.8.0,
scipy, version >= 0.13.0,
matplotlib, version >= 1.3.1,
audioread, version >= 2.1.2,
librosa, version >= 0.4.1`
